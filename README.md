### Game Mechanics

The logic of identifying if a person has mastered the game is through reaching the highest score of 2048. 
1. This is calculated by the game on the basis of number of merges the player does and what was the size of the cell he merged. 
2. The score achieved by the player in one round is saved as the highest score.
3. Goal is to reach as high of a score as possible so as beat the earlier score.

### How to Play:

Use swipe to move the tiles. When tiles with same number touches they merge to form a new tile of 2x its number.
